# Bluesky Social Image Posting Module

## Overview
This module provides a streamlined solution for posting images to Bluesky Social. It abstracts the complexities involved in interacting with the Bluesky Social API, offering a simple interface for image uploads and post creation.

## Features
- **Multiple Image Support**: Allows posting multiple images in a single post.
- **Flexible Text Posting**: Enables posts with or without accompanying text.
- **File Type Validation**: Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats, ensuring robust handling of image files.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file existence, file types, and API interactions.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrable into larger projects or standalone applications.

## Limitations
- **File Type Support**: Currently, the Bluesky Social API supports only JPG, JPEG, and PNG file formats. This limitation is reflected in the module's validation process.
- **API Dependencies**: The module's functionality is dependent on the stability and availability of the Bluesky Social API.

## Installation
Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system, then clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]
npm install
```

## Usage
The module's functionality is encapsulated in `postWithImages.js`. Here's a guide to using it in your project:

### Setting up the BskyAgent
Set up and log in to the `BskyAgent` in your main file (e.g., `main.js`):

```javascript
// main.js
require('dotenv').config();
const { BskyAgent } = require('@atproto/api');
const sendPostWithImages = require('./postWithImages');

async function main() {
    const agent = new BskyAgent({ service: 'https://bsky.social' });
    await agent.login({
        identifier: process.env.IDENTIFIER,
        password: process.env.PASSWORD,
    });

    // Additional code...
}

main();
```

### Creating a Post with Images
Use the `sendPostWithImages` function to post images:

```javascript
// Example usage
try {
    const imagePaths = ['./path/to/image1.jpg', './path/to/image2.jpeg'];
    const text = 'Optional post text';
    await sendPostWithImages(agent, imagePaths, text);
    console.log('Post created!');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```
